This program was created by Keith Ecker and Andy Achenreiner for CS 537 
assignment 1. For this assignment we created a program that retrieves the 
processes of the OS and prints certain data of the process based on arguments. 
To run this program you must type the name of the program and then add desired 
option by typing '-' then the character of the option. All options must be 
seperated by a space and options may be turned off by adding a '-' after the 
option character. The program will exit if the user attempts to pass a non 
integer value to the '-p' option, if the argument passed to the '-p' option is 
not a valid process id, or if the user attempts to add an option that does not 
exists such as '-x'.
