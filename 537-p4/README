This program was created by Keith Ecker and Andy Achenreiner for CS537. This 
program recreates the malloc, free, and realloc functions to check for basic 
invalid inputs. We also created a function named memcheck which takes a void 
pointer and a size_t and checks whether this memory is contained within a block 
of memory that was allocated using our functions. We use a AVL tree to track 
all memory allocated, freed, and reallocted using our functions. 12/6/2018

Note that the file containing main can be set for the main variable in the
makefile.
